# Minimum Operations

## Algorithm

This project involves solving the "Minimum Operations" problem using Python. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to generate exactly `n` characters of 'H' in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

### Tasks

**0. Minimum Operations** (Mandatory)

- **Description:** In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file.
- **Prototype:** `def minOperations(n)`
- **Returns:** An integer indicating the minimum number of operations, or `0` if `n` is impossible to achieve.
- **Example:**

    ```python
    n = 9
    H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH
    Number of operations: 6
    ```

- **Example Code:**

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/python3
    """
    Main file for testing
    """

    minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

    n = 4
    print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

    n = 12
    print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
    ```
